# pipelang
Pipelines for large language models. Features of langchain but with extensibility, versatility, and transparency and without the complexity.

Features:
* Base Pipeline system
* LLMs (only OpenAI so far)
* Prompts (with all the langchain prompts)
* Chains and Splitters (All the ones from langchain)

Future:
* Thorough type-checking
* Asynchronous calls
* Memory
* Flowchart generation / Computation graph
* Pipeline factories
* Tracing

Attributions:
* Langchain, which taught me a lot on modern techniques in working with LLM's such as chains and agents, as well as the framework
* React, which taught me FP and what a simple, powerful and extensible API looks like
